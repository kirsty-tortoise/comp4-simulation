# Mechanics simulations

This was aa project I had to make for my A2 Computing Coursework. There was LOTS of writing that I had to do as well, but I'm fairly sure you don't want to read that. There is also a user manual that I had to make, although I should update it for setting up if you get the code from Github.

Anyway, it is a mechanics simulation thing for the M3 MEI syllabus. It has 4 simulations, and they have things that move about and graphs and stuff. It was made in Processing, Python mode, because I know Python and Processing was nice and simple enough. You will need Processing installed to run this, and you will need Python Mode installed, which can be done in the top right corner of a Processing window. Then you run the COMP4_Simulation file, and it should all work. Hopefully.
